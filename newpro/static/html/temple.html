Vadapalani Andavar Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Muruga. It is located in Vadapalani, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.
It was renovated in the 1920s and a Rajagopuram was built during that time. The temple has grown in popularity, which is believed to be 
in part due to the patronage of cinema stars.The temple started initially as a thatched hut where Murugan's ardent devotee Annaswami 
Nayakar kept a portrait of the God and worshipped him. The temple was built on the same site as the thatched hut around 1890. 
He was the founder and the first priest of the temple. The Vadapalani temple became famous because of the Arul Vaakku and the ability 
to foretell events, as Annaswami Nayakar's words carried the truth. The devotees believed his sacred words gave effective solutions 
to problems, including education, failure in examinations, marriage issues, ailments, and unemployment, among others. The disciple of 
Annaswami Nayakar, Rathinasamy Chettiyar continued the tradition and was blessed with the same divine energy and ability of Arul Vaakku. 
The temple underwent renovation in 1920, and over the past century, devotees throng the temple in huge numbers.
