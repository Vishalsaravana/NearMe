Semmozhi Poonga, variously spelled as Semmoli Poonga (literally translated to "Classical Language Park"), is a botanical garden in 
Chennai set up jointly by the Horticulture and Agricultural Engineering department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. 
The garden was opened on 24 November 2010 by then chief Minister M. Karunanidhi and is the first botanical garden in the city.

Hotel. Encompassing an area of 20 acres (320 grounds),it was built at a cost of ₹ 80 million. More than 500 species of plants are 
being grown in the area, in addition to the 80 trees that was already in existence during the development of the park, some of them 
being more than 100 years old. The garden houses some of the popular exotic flora and rare plant species, medicinal and aromatic herbs.
Many of the exotic plants are imported from countries like China and Thailand, including a plethora of bonsai varieties of ficus 
microcarpa and ficus ginseng.
