M.G.R Memorial Complex is a memorial complex built on the Marina beach in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. 
Spread over 8.25 acres, the memorial is located adjacent to the Anna Memorial.It was built in memory of former chief ministers of 
Tamil Nadu who died in office, M. G. Ramachandran and his protégé J. Jayalalithaa, whose bodies were buried at the site on 
25 December 1987 and 6 December 2016, respectively.The memorial was built in 1988 and inaugurated by V. N. Janaki Ramachandran, 
wife of M. G. Ramachandran, in May 1990.The memorial was remodelled and the complex was laid with marble and opened in 1992 by
J. Jayalalithaa who had become the chief minister of the state of Tamil Nadu in the previous year. When J. Jayalalithaa died on
5 December 2016, she was buried next to MGR. This structure was designed by architect K. Ramachandran, retired chief architect
of PWD. Between 1996 and 1998, the mausoleum was again renovated at a cost of about ₹ 27.5 million. When the Indian Ocean tsunami 
struck the seafront in December 2004, the memorial was damaged. Repair works cost approximately ₹ 13.3 million.
